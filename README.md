# Robot Arm Control: Implementing an Intelligent Agent

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on developing an intelligent agent to control a robotic arm for a **pick-and-place** task. The agent incorporates **object recognition, motion planning, and closed-loop control** to efficiently manipulate objects.

## 🚀 Features
- **Object Identification:** Recognizes objects, their positions, and orientations using vision and depth sensors.
- **Motion Planning:** Generates an optimal trajectory for precise movement while avoiding obstacles.
- **Grasping & Placement:** Ensures secure grasping and accurate object placement.
- **Closed-Loop Control:** Uses real-time sensor feedback for precise adjustments.
- **Simulation & Testing:** Evaluates system performance in a virtual environment.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Computer Vision** (for object detection)
- **Machine Learning** (for object recognition)
- **Motion Planning Algorithms** (for trajectory calculation)
- **Robot Operating System (ROS)** *(if applicable)*
- **Simulation Tools** (Gazebo, MATLAB, or other frameworks)

## 🔍 Challenges & Solutions
- **Sensor Noise:** Applied filtering techniques to reduce errors.
- **Calibration Issues:** Implemented precise arm calibration techniques.
- **Dynamic Environments:** Designed adaptive control strategies to handle object variations.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Advanced **AI-based motion planning** for real-time decision-making.
- Integration with **reinforcement learning** to improve grasping techniques.
- Deploying the system in **real-world robotic applications**.
